	<span class="Green">Classes and Equipment</span>
	
	<p>Most gyms offer a variety of cardiovascular-based exercise machines 
		(like treadmills and exercise bikes) and strength training equipment (such as weights),
		 plus a choice of exercise classes to suit most age groups and fitness levels.<br/><br/>
	
	You can expect a number of names and formats for classes, like pump, spinning, gravity and Pilates. Don't be afraid to ask what the classes focus on, and how busy<br/><br/> they usually are. Check to see that the classes on offer appeal to you, and that they're on at a convenient time.
	
	If you intend to use the machines, make sure there is a wide selection and that they have easy-to-understand charts and instructions close at hand.<br/><brf/> <br/> Theequipment should be clean and well maintained.
	
	Staff should be available to handle any enquires about operating the equipment, and to advise on the correct technique during exercises.</p>

	Optional Extras
</span>
<p>Some gyms may offer a variety of additional programs and services,<br/><br/> such as nutrition advice, weight loss challenges, lifestyle seminars, boot camp, walking groups and personal training.

Others may have a juice bar, pool, spa or sauna, or rooms designated for specific activities like stretching and massage.<br><br>

You will have to pay extra for many of these add-ons, although you may get a free introductory trial included with your membership.

If these additional services are important to you, weigh up the costs, and make sure you aren't paying more for something that you could find elsewhere.</p>
